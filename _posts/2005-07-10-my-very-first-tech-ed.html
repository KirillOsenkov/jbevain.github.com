title: My very first Tech-Ed

<br /><h3>The Tech-Ed itself</h3>

Last week, I attended Tech-Ed Europe. Wow, at least six thousand people were there. The average level of talks was pretty good. Things like Indigo and the DSL tools seems at least promising. There is a bunch of blogs about the event, so I won't make another one.

It was nice to meet there <a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sami/">L'ami Sami</a>, <a href="http://www.brainsonic.fr/">Jean-Louis</a>, and <a href="http://rafaelmizrahi.blogspot.com/">Rafi</a> from the Mainsoft team.

  It's the only Mono t-shirt i've spotted during the whole event!

  My friend <a href="http://blogs.labo-dotnet.com/batswirl">Mathieu</a> and I decided that we both needed a picture "a la" <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/weblog/">Ingo Rammer</a>, here is mine:

  Sadly, now that I have one, I'm still not as smart as him. His first <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/weblog/archives/001428.html">talk</a> was simple, yet effective, and he is a very skilled speaker. Yes, i've been impressed by this one.

<h3>Amsterdam</h3>

<p>
  Amsterdam is a somewhat disturbing city. People there are loving blue and yellow things during the day, like their trains for instance:

  I know that you know, the color they love at night:

<p>
  Ok, it was not the one you expected. You won't have pics of the red district. Please note that this picture has nothing to do with Mainsoft.
</p>

<p>
  At least two or three people by day have asked us "extasy ? coke ?" while we were walking through the city. Another one asked us "sucking ? licking ? fucking ?". Somewhat disturbing I said.
</p>

<p>
  However, i've loved the architecture of the city, and some appartements looked very nice, but the life there seems very expensive. More than in Paris...

  I'm now working back on Cecil, but this will be the subject of another blog entry.
