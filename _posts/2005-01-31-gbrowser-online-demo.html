<br />Everyone is talking about that. Google is hiring a lot of FireFox developers.<br />
<br />
This is <b>the</b> buzz of the beginning of the year. Google is already on your desktop, now, it intends to control your main application: the internet browser. You can read some more stuff <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BCB1AB36C-D097-4451-93C4-A19141400FB5%7D&amp;siteid=google&amp;dist=google">here</a> for example.<br />
<br />
Once again, people are talking a lot, sometimes without even knowing what is really happening.<br /> Do not wonder on how I get it, but the fact are there, I've an online demo of the next gen browser by our favorite search engine company. Go try it now !<br />
