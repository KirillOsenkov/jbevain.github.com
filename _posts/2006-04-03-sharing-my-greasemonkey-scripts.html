title: Sharing my GreaseMonkey scripts
---
<br /><p>
I hope you all know the <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> FireFox's extension which allows you to modify your favorite sites as you want. <br />
I've setted up a <a href="http://evain.net/blog/index.php/greasemonkey">page</a> to put the GreaseMonkey scripts I've wrote and still use.
</p>
<p>
Check the one to navigate through Google's results with the keyboard. <br />
For the moment there is only a couple of scripts, but I'll update the page as long as I'll write new scripts.
