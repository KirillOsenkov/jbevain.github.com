title: Mono.Cecil 0.9.1
---
I pushed to my <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil">github</a> repository an update for <a href="http://mono-project.com/Cecil/">Mono.Cecil</a>. It contains a week worth of fixes reported by the folks who ported their code to use the new API. The main addition for this release is the support for complex types in custom attributes, which was pretty much the only known thing that was not supported in 0.9, metadata wise.

Thanks to everyone that took the time to update to 0.9 and report issues.
