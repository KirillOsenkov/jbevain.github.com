<br /><p>
I spent last year teaching .net and web technologies. In the mean time, I also gave a few speachs in some conferences. None of my presentations were even close to this one:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">OSCON 2005 Keynote</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Which is one of the best presentation I've ever watched.
