I've recently noticed that ohloh now allows you to publish a journal, made of short entries (less than 400 characters).

It feels more specialized than twitter, and pretty useful to log short updates on what I am hacking on, or short news for a project. For instance, <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/poupou">SÃ©bastien</a> already started using it to publish short news about <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/gendarme">Gendarme</a>.

That looks pretty nice to me, let see what ends up in <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/jbevain/messages">my ohloh journal</a>.
