<br /><h3>Today, I stop using Windows</h3>
<p>
  For the past last years, I've been using Windows. Yesterday, my love has gone away: I've received my PowerBook. Mac OS X Tiger is damn eye candy, but i'm looking toward installing something like an Ubuntu on the free space i've reserved for a Linux system.

  I felt very productive and fast with my Windows XP box, it will take some time before being as eased with this new system as with my old laptop. Fortunately, x-develop is cross platform, i can continue to work on Cecil. Cecil that works without a hint here. I was afraid to have some endianess issue, but it seems that everything is fine. Wow!
