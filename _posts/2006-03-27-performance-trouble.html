title: Performance Trouble
---
<br /><p>
Yesterday, while my troubles seemed far away, I was hacking on <a href="http://mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a>. When running a common test, round-tripping mcs, I realized that it was taking twice the time it used to do so. I anxiously got back in the time one revision to another, because I had just introduced some caching mechanism. After a dozen of commits, I still had not found what the problem was.

Then I plugged the power cable into the side of my PowerBook G4, and everything went well.

Now I need a place to hide away.
