title: Projects using Cecil
---
A month ago, <a href="http://themonkeysgrinder.blogspot.com/">Scott</a> had the good idea to start a page on the <a href="http://mono-project.com/Cecil">Mono.Cecil</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil">google group</a>, to try to list the different projects out there that are using Cecil. The page is wisely named <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil/web/projects-using-cecil">Projects using Cecil</a>. I've tried to complete it by myself, but I'm for sure missing some of my users.<br />
<br />
So if you're using Cecil, that would be cool to have you listed there. Feel free to change the page yourself, or to drop a name, a summary and if possible a link in the comments.<br />
<br />
For bonus points, you can describe what you use Cecil for.<br />
