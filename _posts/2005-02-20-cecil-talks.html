title: Cecil talks
---
<br />A long time I have not blogged. Mainly spent my time working on Cecil. Better than a long talk, here is an example of what Cecil is able to do now. There is a name for programs that write themselves, I've forget it, and my example is not really one of them. My example is a very simple C# console program, but it will print its CIL representation, almost like ildasm.<br />
<br />
I've not included the source and the result on the blog, because they are not really short. The source is viewable here : <a href="http://evain.net/public/cecil_il_sample_source.html">C# source</a>. We simply load an assembly using Cecil, then we print the content of the methods. Easy no ? Let's take a look at the output : <a href="http://evain.net/public/cecil_il_sample_output.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I have still a lot of work to do, and the API is not really stable, but I'm close to what I want. Once I'll get it, I think I'll call for contribution on this blog, to achieve the writing part of Cecil. Stay tuned !<br />
