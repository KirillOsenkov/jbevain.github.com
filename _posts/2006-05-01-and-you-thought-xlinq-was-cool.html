title: And you thought XLinq was cool?
---
<p>
Today, I'm stuck to bed due to something that appears to be a Gastroenteritis.
Don't worry, I won't give any detail, but wow, I've forgot I contain so much
<i>fluids</i>.
</p>
<p>
Please notice that there is no relation between XLinq and Gastroenteritis.

I've read with pleasure <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2006/01/04/creating-xml-with-ruby-and-builder.html">this article</a> about a new way
to create xml files using ruby. And I've wonder how can I have the same
thing on Mono. All I needed, was a language which supports duck typing.
I have <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">boo</a>. I'm not a sitting duck Miles!
</p>
<p>
I took me a little more than an hour to have something working like the ruby library.
I've translated the end of the article, which is about the creation of a xhtml document.
Here is <a href="http://evain.net/public/xhtml.boo.html">my boo version</a>

import System

import NUnit.Framework

[TestFixture]
class XhtmlTestFixture:

    [Test]
    def go():
        x = XmlBuilder(Console.Out)

        x.Instruct_("xml",
            {"version" : "1.0", "encoding" : "utf-8"})

        x.Declare_("html", "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN",
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd")

        x.html() do:
            x.head() do:
                x.title("My Projects")
                x.style({"type" : "text/css"}) do:
                    x.Text_("body {font-family: courier new;}")

            x.body() do:
                x.h1("My projects")

                x.p("The projects I'm working on:")

                x.ul() do:
                    x.li("Mono")
                    x.li("Cecil")
                    x.li("...")
</pre>
<p>
<a href="http://evain.net/public/xmlbuilder.zip">Here is the project</a> of the whole thing, including unit tests.
</p>
<p>
Notice that it could of course be improved, especially, the XmlBuilder thing could
extends XmlTextWriter. But this was simple enough for me. Cool huh?
