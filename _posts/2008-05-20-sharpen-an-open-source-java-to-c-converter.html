Today folks at <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/">db4o</a> released <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/Resources/view.aspx/Reference/Sharpen">Sharpen</a>, an open source Java to C# converter.

Am happy to see this coming, as it is soming I've pushed strongly for when I was working at <a href="http://www.db4o.com">db4objects</a>, and was hacking on it, mentored by its main developer, <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a>. There I had the chance to <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/blogs/product_news/archive/2006/11/15/new-conventions-for-db4o-on-net.aspx">improve</a> the <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/blogs/product_news/archive/2007/04/23/adding-love-to-the-c-sources.aspx">generated code</a>, to make it look like hand written code, that follows .net conventions.

It's nothing magic, and requires compromises on both the Java and the generated C#, but it's pretty handy, easily hackable, and all in all, damn useful.

Rodrigo wrote a <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/blogs/product_news/archive/2008/05/20/smart-java-to-c-conversion-for-the-masses-with-sharpen.aspx">nice tutorial</a> on Sharpen.

Time to port your Java applications to the amazing <a href="http://mono-project.com.">Mono</a>!
