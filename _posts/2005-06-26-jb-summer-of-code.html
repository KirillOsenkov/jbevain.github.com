title: Jb Summer Of Code
---
<br /><h3>Me</h3>
<p>
Two days ago, it was the Saint Jean-Baptiste day. As Jb stands for Jean-Baptiste, this sounds good. Now, the summer can begin.
</p> 
<h3>On Google things</h3>
<p>
My proposal has been accepted! I'm late (i've some reasons), but now, this is sure, i have to, finish Cecil by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Google haved here a really nice idea, some Open Source projects will shine more at the end of the summer.

GNOME Games and ipods in trains are damn useful! Just make sure girls won't play with them for the whole trip...
Happily, all of the batteries were low.

<p>
This morning, I was in the 'Lyon Part Dieu' train station, and i had the good surprise to find here a friend from high school i haven't seen for at least two years. I've waited for his train with him. Enjoy journeying!
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, i'll wake up at 4.am, objective: lunch in Mulhouse, and sleep in Paris. At least ten hours of car.
