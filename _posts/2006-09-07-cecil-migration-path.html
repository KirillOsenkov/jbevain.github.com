title: Cecil migration path
---
I started working on what will be the next version of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a>. I have introduced quite a bunch of breaking changes. For instance I've removed all the pointless interfaces that were part of the old API.

To ensure a smooth transition, I've written a migration script that you can use to port your code. The script is located <a href="http://mono.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/cecil/lib/CodeGen/cecil-mig.rb">here</a>. It has been succesfully used on a few projects in the cecil module, like <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> or permview. It also works for the parts of <a href="http://www.db4o.com">db4o</a> which depend upon Cecil.

All you need is a ruby interpreter:

<pre>
ruby cecil-mig.rb path/to/source
</pre>
