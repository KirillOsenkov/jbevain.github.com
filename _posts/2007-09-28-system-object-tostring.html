Today, <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=329419">I've patched</a> our implementation of <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.aspx?tlink=11@ecma%3a131%23Object%2fM%2f7">System.Object::ToString ()</a>. Do you realize that every time you'll use ToString in Mono you'll be executing a line I actually wrote? That's simply amazing. I felt like I was literally modifying the blueprints of the known universe.<br />
