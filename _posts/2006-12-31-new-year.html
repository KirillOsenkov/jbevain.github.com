The last year for me has been pretty amazing. I've created my own personal company, got a wonderful position at <a href="http://www.db4o.com/">db4objects, Inc.</a>, met and made friends with very nice people, traveled around the world, worked on very exciting projects, and the next year looks as exciting as the previous one was.

Next week, I'm going to Hong-Kong for a db4o meeting. In February, I'll be speaking about Mono and db4o at Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/france/mstechdays/">Techdays</a> in Paris. I'll also be at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, where I'll have a lightning talk about db4o. In April, I'll be visiting my mentor, co-worker, and friend <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a> in Brazil, so we can go to the International Open-Source Forum. And that's only for the first half of 2007.

So what more could I expect for the next year? Maybe it's time for me to take care of other people's expectations?

I wish you all a tremendous year 2007.
