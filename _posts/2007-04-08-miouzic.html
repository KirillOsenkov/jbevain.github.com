I use to listen to some good music when I work, and I also tend to listen to it with an headset. I'm running OpenSUSE 10.2, and I missed the ability to change quickly the default card used by ALSA when some applications, like my version of <a href="http://banshee-project.org">Banshee</a> doesn't allow to change easily the output card. So I quickly hacked a little application that allows me to do so:

It works pretty well for me, so feel free to <a href="http://evain.net/public/miouzic.tar.gz">download</a> it, to modify it, to redistribute it. License is MIT/X11.
