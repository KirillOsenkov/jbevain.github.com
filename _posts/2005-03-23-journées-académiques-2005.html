title: Journées Académiques 2005
---
<br />I have the honor to be one of the speaker of the "Academic Days" event, my talk is about Aspect Oriented Programming on the .net framework.<br />
<br />
I have to admit that i'm really impressed, I'll meet there people like John Lefor, PM for the Phoenix project at MSR. It seems that we share some ideas on compiler design, I hope I'll be able to talk with him a little. Serge Lidin, the author of Inside .NET IL Assembler, and the writer of ildasm, ilasm, peverify, ..., will be here too, talking about the the evolution of the CIL. Be sure I'll hear carefully ! Should be 3 exciting days ! All details <a href="http://galilee.microsoft.fr/JA2005/">here</a>.
