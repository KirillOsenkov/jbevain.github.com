My good friend <a href="http://sample4.net">Renaud</a> just landed in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=bamako+mali&ll=12.649999,-7.989999&spn=45.947838,111.09375&t=k">Bamako, Mali</a> (Zoom, zoom, zoom).

Thanks to his Mono and Linux skills, he has been hired by <a href="http://geekcorps.org/">Geekcorps</a> to help creating digital kiosks providing internet services in rural areas using Free Software. I like to think of him as a humanitarian developer.
