There was <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/12/04/i-love-ayende-and-oss.aspx">a discussion</a> recently about why the class <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb882521.aspx">ExpressionVisitor</a>, which every programmer that developed a LINQ provider or code manipulating .net 3.5 expression trees knows about.

I certainly agree that this class could have been made public, as basically everyone ends up embedding it. Even if it could use a little refactoring to visit lists.

Thing is that I have a naming issue with this class ever since I saw it on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2007/07/31/linq-building-an-iqueryable-provider-part-ii.aspx">Matt's blog</a>. To me it does more than just visiting an expression tree. It allows you to transform it. And when I'm facing an expression tree, I often like to sometimes visit it, and at some other times, transform it.

That's basically the reason why I have both a:

<pre>
class ExpressionVisitor {

    public void Visit (Expression expression)
    {
        // ..
    }

    // ...
}
</pre>

And a:

<pre>
class ExpressionTransformer {

    public Expression Visit (Expression expression)
    {
        // ..
    }

    // ...
}
</pre>

Simply because I write a lot of code that would look like:

<pre>
SomethingExpression VisitSomethingExpression (SomethingExpression expression)
{
    if (Foo (expression))
        return expression;

    if (Bar (expression))
        return expression;

    Baz (expression);
    return expression;
}

</pre>

And it looks a lot better (and is also a tiny bit faster) this way:

<pre>

void VisitSomethingExpression (SomethingExpression expression)
{
    if (Foo (expression))
        return;

    if (Bar (expression))
        return;

    Baz (expression);
}
</pre>

So if they make the current ExpressionVisitor public, having a real non transforming ExpressionVisitor will introduce an interesting naming issue.

I submitted a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1101">bug to the DLR CodePlex</a>, as the namespace System.Linq.Expressions will come from the DLR in .net 4. What about voting for it?
