I his <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2006-December/021611.html">last mail</a> to mono-devel, <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/">Miguel</a> says:

<blockquote>
With the new Moma (1.1) that was released yesterday we have now 105
fresh reports (with the old version we have 525), and I have written
some scripts that publish the information in easy to digest information.<br />

<a href="http://mono-project.com/Moma">Moma</a> is our Migration Analyser tool. As you may not know, it's based on <a href="http://evain.net/blog/">Cecil</a>. It's a great occasion for Cecil to be widely tested on the most surprising assemblies you can find.

So far, I had only two bugs reported. 2 out of 630 is not that bad, but still, Cecil can do better. So if ever Moma fails to analyse your assembly, please file a bug report in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/">Bugzilla</a>, component Mono.Cecil. And please attach the offending assembly as well, it's my best chance to fix the bug.

If you cannot attach the assembly for any reason, please drop it by mail, I won't spread it accross internet !
