Following an excellent suggestion, I've created a Google Group for Mono.Cecil related stuff, as I ended up answering every question by mail.

You can access it here: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil">Mono.Cecil group</a>.

Please, dear all Cecil users, please post questions there instead of sending them to me by mail. Thanks!

And now for no reason but beauty, a picture of my trip in Brazil:
