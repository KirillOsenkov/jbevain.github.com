<br /><h3>I've played with Lego today</h3>
<p>
Well, it was some kind of special Lego... I've taken bricks from :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A nice tutorial about <a href="http://mono-project.com/GtkSharpNotificationIcon">Tray Icons for GNOME</a></li>
  <li>An perfect and simple <a href="http://rlove.org/log/2004110201">example</a></li>
  <li>An amazing <a href="http://www.mono-live.com/">Mono Live</a></li>
  <li>GPL icons from a nice <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/gmailapi/">project</a></li>
  <li>A simple <a href="http://code.google.com/apis.html#gmail">ATOM feed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
With those bricks, I've made a very simple and totally incomplete <b>GMail Notification Icon for GNOME</b>. It looks like that:
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

</p>
<p>
Yet, it's no really usable. Username and password are hard-coded, and you just know if you have, or not, unread mails.
</p>
<p>
If someone is willing to use my code to produce a better applet, he would not have a lot of things to do. The list is simple:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use GConf to save username and password</li>
  <li>Write a really simple window to ask user whether or not username and password have to be stored</li>
  <li>Write another simple window to be shown when a new mail arrives, and then disappears</li>
</ul>
<p>
This nice person will find the code here: <a href="http://evain.net/public/gmailtray.tar.gz">GMailTray</a>
