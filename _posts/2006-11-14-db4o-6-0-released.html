title: db4o 6.0 released
---
I've very thrilled to announce the release today of <a href="http://www.db4o.com/about/news/release/2006_11_14.aspx">db4o 6.0</a>, our brand new release.

Some lucky folks have seen at the Mono Meeting some bits of what's new in it. <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a> and I've been mainly busy bringing some love to the public API, to make it look like a real .net/Mono library. And now that's what it really is.

<pre>
using Db4objects.Db4o;
using Db4objects.Db4o.Query;

class Test
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        using (IObjectContainer store = Db4oFactory.OpenFile("test.yap"))
        {
            IQuery q = store.Query();
            q.Constrain(typeof(Person));

            foreach (Person p in q.Execute())
            {
                Console.WriteLine (p);
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

Here is the sample extracted from <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/blogs/product_news/archive/2006/11/15/new-conventions-for-db4o-on-net.aspx">my blog post</a> where I describe all the changes.

That's the release I've been the more excited with. You can feel that it's all packed with love. Go <a href="http://www.db4o.com/about/news/release/2006_11_14.aspx">give it a try</a>.
