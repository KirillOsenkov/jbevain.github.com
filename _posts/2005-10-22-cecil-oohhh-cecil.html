Long time no blog.

<h3>Cecil & Generics folks</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~martin/blog/index.php">Martin</a> helped implement generic support in Cecil. A few bugs of mine still live in the SVN, but it should be ok before the end of the month.

<h3>Security !</h3>
<a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">Sébastien Pouliot</a> implemented the support for 2.0 security declarations in Cecil.
<h3>Modest release love</h3>
<p>
Let say it there and now: Cecil 0.1 will be released before the end of the month.
If not, burn a picture of me. Once this done, I'll explain how to use it ;)
