For the fourth time, <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> has been accepted as a mentoring organization for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Google's Summer of Code</a>.

I started contributing to Mono at the end of 2004, and I was lucky to be accepted as a student for the very first Summer of Code during the <a href="http://mono-project.com/Summer2005">2005 summer</a>. And I was even luckier to be <a href="http://mono-project.com/Summer2006#A_CIL_Linker">accepted again the year after</a>. This year, just like the year before, I'm a possible mentor.

The Summer of Code is an amazing opportunity for young developers to be involved in a FOSS project, to learn, to practice programming on exciting projects, while being surrounded with talented peoples. And also to have a great summer. And to get a cool t-shirt.

Oh, and for what it's worth, five students (including me) from the previous SoC editions are now employed by <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> to work on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> or <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Moonlight</a>.

So yeah, if I had an advice, that would be to go have a look at <a href="http://mono-project.com/StudentProjects">the proposed tasks</a>, you can even submit your own original proposal if you think you have a bright idea, and apply for it. You have three days.
