title: Cecil and the Summer Of Code
---
<p>
<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a> is a project I started in November 2004. I worked on it's write support during the Summer 2005, thanks to Google's Summer Of Code.
</p>
<p>
During this first <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Summer2005">Summer Of Code</a>, already one SoC project was using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a>, and it's now included in <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a>
</p>
<p>
For the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects">Summer Of Code 2006</a>, a the whole set of suggestions about <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#CIL-based_tools">CIL (4 suggestions)</a> requires to use Cecil.

<p>
What a promotion for my tool!
