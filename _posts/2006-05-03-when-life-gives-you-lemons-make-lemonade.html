title: When Life Gives You Lemons, Make Lemonade
---
<p>
Back a few years ago, when I was studying in Lyon. It was around 3am, and I was eating some (delicious) junk food with my friend <a href="http://sample4.net">renaud</a>, sitting in my car, dreaming of people like <a href="http://tirania.org">Miguel</a> and others Ximian folks, paid for working on Free Software. Sweet dreams are made of this...
The fact is that, starting yesterday, we are both "paid" to work on free software and it's tons of fun.

I'm proud to announce that I'm now part of the <a  href="http://www.db4o.com">db4o</a> team where I'll be working with folks like <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a>.

I'll mainly be working on Cecil related stuff, like the native queries functionalities, but also on exciting things I'll tell you later.
