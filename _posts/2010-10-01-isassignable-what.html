title: IsAssignable what?
---
I've <a href="http://twitter.com/jbevain/status/18703683699">tweeted</a> it before, <a href="http://jacksonh.tumblr.com/">Jackson</a> <a href="http://jacksonh.tumblr.com/post/947513238/tired-of-getting-isassignablefrom-wrong-public">tumblered</a> it in return, but after commenting on a StackOverflow answer where the poster got it wrong, commenting:

<blockquote>I always seem to turn that call around.</blockquote>

I felt that I needed to broaden this grand hack. If you're like me, and apparently like a lot of coders out there, you tend to always get <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.isassignablefrom.aspx">Type.IsAssignableFrom</a> wrong on the first try, then you need this extension method:


<pre name="code" class="c-sharp:nocontrols:nogutter">
public static bool IsAssignableTo (this Type self, Type type)
{
	if (self == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException ("self");
	if (type == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException ("type");

	return type.IsAssignableFrom (self);
}
</pre>

Somehow, even if IsAssignableFrom is more «left to rightish», preserving the side of the arguments a real assignment would have, I understand IsAssignableTo faster. For what it's worth, I've used it extensively while writing our .net 3.5 implementation of System.Linq.Expressions, and it served me well.

Have a great friday.
