title: Xml Indent

<br /><p>
A <a href="http://sample4.net">friend</a> asked me this morning how he could simply indent an XML file. You know, I'm a software programmer, I can afford to deal with such complicated problems, so I've written a fully managed Xml Pretty Printer.  Of course it's Open Source, and freely downloadable here:

All thanks goes to the authors of System.Xml :)
