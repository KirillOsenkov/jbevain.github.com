My friend <a href="http://blogs.labo-dotnet.com/patrice/">Patrice</a> just came to spend a few days in Mulhouse.<br />
He just introduced <a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu</a> to me.
How have I lived without knowing this web site?
</p>
<p>
Lulu is simply a self, free publishing platform for a whole kind of items. Maybe the best link is the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/about/whatislulu.php">video tour</a>.

 For the very first time, the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Brassens">Georges</a> was <a href="http://www.paroles.net/chansons/14991.html">wrong</a>, Lulu is really appealing!
