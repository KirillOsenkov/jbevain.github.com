If Microsoft have an interest in Mono, it's in education. It's one of their best option to make C# enter colleges and universities.

Microsoft France understands it, and so, I'll be presenting <b>Mono for research and education</b>, at <a href="http://galilee.microsoft.fr/JA2006/">Microsoft's Academics days</a> in Paris. It's one of the best event from Microsoft France, technically speaking. Drop me a line if you will attend!
