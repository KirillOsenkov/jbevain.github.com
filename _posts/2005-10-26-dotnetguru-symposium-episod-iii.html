title: DotNetGuru Symposium, Episod III
---
<br /><p>
Last monday I attended with more than 600 persons the third edition of the DotNetGuru Symposium. Last year I did a very brief Mono presentation. This edition was in the DotNetGuru tradition focused on high quality software development. They talked about n-tiers patterns, software industrialization, Smart clients, and then DSL. The nice and short sessions "after lunch", to help people digest, were presented by my friends <a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sebastienros/">Sébastien Ros</a> on the implementation of Linq in his next gen ORM tool and <a href="http://www.dotnetguru.biz/">Thomas Gil</a>.

The apogee of the event was the Q&A  with Bill Gates. I was five meters in front of the richest man of the world. I decided not to be impressed and I looked at him with my look "I've already won", slightly the one you could use with girls, but with nuances of threat. And you know what ? He didn't look scared...
