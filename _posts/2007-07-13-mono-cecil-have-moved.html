Yesterday night was filled with emotion. After more than two years in its own module in SVN, the library <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Mono.Cecil</a> have moved to a shiner place, right where the core assemblies are, in the <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs/">mcs</a> module.<br />
<br />
Dear Cecil users, you'll now have to check Cecil out from <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs/class/Mono.Cecil/">mcs/class/Mono.Cecil</a>.<br />
<br />
Yet, Cecil's API is not set in stone, so if Cecil makes it to the GAC, you'll still have to keep a private copy of Cecil for your developments, as it won't be deployed as a package, you'll need a private copy during the compilation.<br />
<br />
As soon as I can freeze the API, it will be packaged like the other assemblies. But this is another story.<br />
