<br /><h3>Tech'Ed</h3>
<p>
Microsoft invited me to the <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/05/pre/content/default.aspx">Tech'Ed Europe</a>, some <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/TechEd/05/Pre/Content/SessionList.aspx">sessions</a> seems very promising. The good point is that I have not yet visited Amsterdam, this is the occasion. I hope to see people there, feel free to mail.
</p>
<h3>AspectDNG</h3>
<p>
Thomas Gil have started using Cecil to produce ILML inside <a href="http://aspectdng.sourceforge.net">AspectDNG</a>, sounds like he is waiting for me to end my job, so that he can use Cecil to convert an ILML file to a valid assembly.
</p>
<h3>OPath</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sebastienros">Sebastien Ros</a> offered me for Christmas his OPath parser library. Two options, I can write a clone of its Eon library that uses it, so that we could query objects graphs, just like Sebastien <a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sebastienros/index.php?p=159&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">does</a>. If I go this way, the Evaluate method should be a generic one, so that we could return strongly typed collections or items. The second option is to integrate natively into Cecil the ability to query the assembly, but it is too much Cecil centric, I'm sure other people wants to play with OPath !

<h3>Microsoft Research</h3>
<p>
I'm finishing my slides for Tuesday, again, the agenda is very promising, the thematic this year is <i>Software Engineering, Architectural Design and High Performance Computing</i>. Hope they'll enjoy AOP AspectDNG's way. I'll be hosted <a href="http://www.novotel.com/novotel/fichehotel/gb/nov/3546/fiche_hotel.shtml">there</a>, (even if I live at 15 minutes from there). Every details <a href="http://galilee.microsoft.fr/JA2005">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>XScale</h3>
<p>
I've look toward installing Linux on my Dell Axim X30 (I don't really know what to do with it), but it looks like it will be a <b>very</b> time consuming task, the Linux port is not <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/AximX30">really ready</a>. However, I've added a new entry in my TODO list: trying to port Mini, Mono's JIT, to this architecture, so that I can learn from inside the Mono runtime. I'll need help, but <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~massi/blog/">Massi</a> said one time that he was working on this on his spare time, and there is some interesting threads in the devel list to read fist. Sounds like it is a good holiday work, but I have to finish Cecil first!
