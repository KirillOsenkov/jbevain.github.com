title: DotNetGuru contributes to Mono, or the contrary

<br /><pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> Mono.Cecil;</pre>
<br />
Tonight, Cecil will leave SourceForge's CVS to a better place, in the sun.<br />
<br />
Cecil's development will now be supported by Mono's SVN. By the way, its name change a little bit. It is now Mono.Cecil, hey, sounds good no ?<br />
<br />
Thanks to Miguel De Icaza, I have received a write access to Mono's SVN last night. Cecil will be a top module until it is mature enough to be bundled with others Mono's assemblies.<br />
<br />
I'm proud, but a lot of work remains, Cecil isn't really usable, but I hope that its new status will improve the speed of the devel, and will bring more feedbacks and bugs reports.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, this blog may be syndicated within the <a href="http://go-mono.com/monologue">Monologue</a>, by this way the world may discovers AspectDNG, and others DNG activities I'll blog on.<br />
<br />
I'll post as soon as migration is ended, to give you instructions to access Cecil's repository. I may blog later on some screen shots of a little Gtk# application, using Cecil, that mimics ildasm, but it is really simple and limited to Cecil progress.<br />
<br />
Isn't the year 2005 beginning very well ?
