<br /><h3>Meet Ximian folks</h3>
<p>
I've met <a href="http://tirania.org/blog">Miguel</a>, <a href="http://nat.org">Nat</a> and <a href="http://blog.trowbridge.org">John</a> when they were in Paris. It was very nice to meet those guys. Even if having four breakfast in two days is a little bit unusual to me, it was two really good days.

<h3>Me</h3>
<p>
If everything goes fine, i should leave paris and move to Mulhouse, near the German border. For curious peoples, here is the "Where i've lived in France" map:
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Jouars-Pontchartrain (78), 14 years</li>
<li>2. Alissas (07), 5 years</li>
<li>3. Lyon (69), 2 years</li>
<li>4. Paris (75), 1 year</li>
<li>5. Mulhouse (68), will be there for at least 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>
Mulhouse looks to be a crappy city, but i'll be close to folks from <a href="http://www.evaluant.com">Evaluant</a>. I won't miss Paris's subway.

<h3>Google Summer Of Code &amp; Cecil</h3>
<p>
I've applied for the <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer Of Code</a>. <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#Cecil">This</a> is the task i'll work on! The previous <a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/jbevain/index.php?title=in_the_mood_for_work&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">roadmap</a> is still up to date. I hope i'll be selected, i'd be very disappointed to miss an opportunity of winning a T-shirt.
</p>
<p>
At least 3 projects from Mono are using Cecil. So I'm happy.
</p>
<p>
Guys from Mainsoft are interested in Cecil as well. Thanks to them, i've nice reports on Cecil's bugs and API. This should accelerate Cecil's development.
