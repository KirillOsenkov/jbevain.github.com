title: Flow Analysis using Cecil
---
<br /><p>
Let me give you a very interesting link: <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/archives/001237_native_queries_under_the_hood.html">Flow Analysis using Cecil</a>.<br />
<br />
The code should land soon in Cecil's SVN module. This is a pretty exciting news, using stuff like this, it will be even easier to write tools like <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a>. Please thanks <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Bamboo</a>'s team in <a href="http://www.db4o.com/">db4o</a> for the great work. I can't wait using it!
