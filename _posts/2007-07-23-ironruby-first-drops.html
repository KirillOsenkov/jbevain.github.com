Congratulations <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John</a> for releasing a <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html">first pre-alpha of IronRuby</a>, and for the way you're driving this.<br />
<br />
On a side note, if you want to try it on Mono, use it with a console whose background is not white, or you'll end up wondering what the hell is going on. IronRuby simply likes to write in white.
