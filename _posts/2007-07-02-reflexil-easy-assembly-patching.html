title: Reflexil, easy assembly patching
---
My old friend <a href="http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/blog/">SÃ©bastien</a> pinged me a few days ago because he started to use Cecil. Let simply say that he was modifying some assemblies to circumvent a natural limitation of whatever program.<br />
<br />
This long time Delphi user like to have a GUI for this kind of hack, so he simply started to write yet another plugin for <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a>.<br />

<br />
The plugin is only in a very early stage, but still, you can deal with primitives types and branches very easily.<br />

You can find <a href="http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/blog/index.php?/archives/9-Reflexil-v0.1.html">here</a> the mandatory introducing post for Reflexil. Even if it's in french, I bet you'll locate the binaries as well as the sources easily.
