title: Little joys about Cecil
---
<br /><p>
Few times ago, Miguel asked me a little tool, which basically round-trip an assembly using Cecil. It's sole purpose is to test the ability of Cecil to read and write without errors any assembly. I'll use it here to demonstrate the results of today's work. If ever you want to have a look at it, you'll find it in svn here: <a href="http://mono.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/cecil/tools/">/trunk/cecil/tools</a>

Sorry for the Windows output but heh, their peverify and ildasm are much better than ours.

So, what can we see here? The point is that Cecil (SVN HEAD) is now able to round-trip without any error the most terrifying assembly for generics stuff: the great C5 library. There is now very few things missing inside Cecil to reach the 2.0 ready status.

You know what? I'm happy!
