title: Mono.Cecil 0.9.2
---
I tagged <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil/tree/0.9.2">Mono.Cecil 0.9.2</a> at the beginning of the week in <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil">Cecil's github</a>. It's a bug fix release, exactly two weeks after the release of 0.9.1.

It's fast, stable, and shiny, thanks to all the contributors and testers of the 0.9 line. It's safe to say that users of the 0.6 line of code are urged to update to this version, and report issues, if any.
