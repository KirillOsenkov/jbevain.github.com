Cecil have benefited from a few great contributions those last days:
</p>
<h3>Programmer's FAQ</h3>
<p>
Fabien Reinle, fellow friend from <a href="http://www.evaluant.com">Evaluant</a> have written a <a href="http://mono-project.com/Cecil:FAQ">programmer's FAQ</a>.
</p>
<h3>Generics support</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~martin/blog/index.php">Martin Baulig</a> have completed the support of generics inside Cecil, so that it can be used in the debugger. It's a great news as Microsoft just released .net 2.
</p>
<h3>Regression test suite</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a> just commited in /trunk/cecil/tests a regression test suite for Cecil. Make sure that you have NUnit, NAnt and boo installed, and press the red button!
</p>
<h3>Flow Analysis</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a>, yes, the same, just commited in /trunk/cecil/flowanalysis his library I told you about <a href="http://evain.net/blog/index.php/2005/11/19/265-flow-analysis-using-cecil">in this blog entry</a>. It can be used as a base layer for a lot of interesting applications. I'll blog on that later on.
</p>
<p>
Cecil 0.2 should be released in the next few days. Keep breathing!
