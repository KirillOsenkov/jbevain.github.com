title: SharpDevelop 2.1 includes Cecil
---
The team working on SharpDevelop just <a href="http://laputa.sharpdevelop.net/SharpDevelopSerralongueBeta1Released.aspx">released the first beta</a> of the new version of their Open-Source .net IDE for Windows.

I'm happy to say that this version now includes Cecil, which is of course used to read the details of the assemblies. They are no longer using the built-in reflection layer of the .net framework because this one sometimes crashes on some special (read badly obfuscated) assemblies.

Hey, that's one more cool user!
