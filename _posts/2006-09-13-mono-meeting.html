Thanks to <a href="http://www.db4o.com">db4o</a> who is sponsoring my trip, I'll be attending the <a href="http://go-mono.com/meeting/">Mono Meeting</a> at the end of October. I'll have two talks here:

<ul>
<li>One about <a href="http://www.db4o.com">db4o</a>, the leading object database,</li>
<li>The other about <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a>, our assembly manipulation library.</li>
</ul>

See you there!
