Two days ago, I was sharing what I was foreseeing for <a href="http://evain.net/blog/articles/2008/07/29/net-4-c-4-and-the-dlr">C# 4 and .net 4</a>, and the integration with the DLR.

Turns out that today, by reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib/archive/2008/07/30/idispatch-support-on-in-ironpython-beta-4.aspx">this post</a>, my eye was caught by the namespace I was thinking about: System.Scripting.

But this post is about the beta 4 of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/">IronPython</a> 2, that hasn't been released yet. But heh, it's easy to forget that latest IronPython code can be <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx">downloaded from CodePlex's TFS</a>.

And it indeed turns out, that in the latest revision, Microsoft.Scripting.Core namespace has been renamed to System.Scripting, and that the DLR AST has been merged into System.Linq.Expressions.

So yeah, I guess we can safely admit that C# 4 will have statements support inside expression trees.

And that .net 4 will contain very cute features for dynamically generating programs, without resorting to emitting plain IL, simply using the DLR, contained in a new assembly (or namespace, if they move some to parts to System.Core), System.Scripting.
