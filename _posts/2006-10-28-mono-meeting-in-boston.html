title: Mono Meeting in Boston
---
This is my last day in Boston, and the sky is falling on me. Literally. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/281544147/" title="It's raining so much">It's raining so much</a> that I hesitate to go outside and walk a little through Boston. Well, it's no so bad, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/281543519/" title="yesterday was a very nice and shiny">yesterday was a very nice and shiny</a> day, and I've been walking like six hours or so, through Boston, Cambridge and Charleston. Damn, it was really nice. So instead of starring at the window, waiting for a reprieve, I decided to do a little blogging.<br/> <br/> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/281542164/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Miguel's Keynot" height="500" src="http://static.flickr.com/89/281542164_675abb1342.jpg" style="BORDER:2px solid black" width="333"/></a><br/> <br/> Still, I don't really know how to sum-up the whole week. It was very nice to eventually meet in person those contributors I've been rubbing elbows with for the last two years. The meeting went fairly well. I'm pretty happy with my two talks:<br/> <ul>   <li>     <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting06/MonoMeeting-Cecil.pdf" target="blank_" title="Cecil: the CIL manipulation library">Cecil:     the CIL manipulation library</a></li>   <li>     <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/meeting06/MonoMeeting-db4o.pdf" target="blank_" title="db4o: a native persistence solution for Mono">db4o:     a native persistence solution for Mono</a></li> </ul> <br/> I'm sorry if they don't look very informative, they were mainly a support for my own talks. It's been quite a pain for me to speak in English on front of almost an hundred people, you'll see that as soon as the videos will be published, but I had a few good feedbacks after that. So in average, I'm pretty happy with the result. Wade, our release engineer, even granted me with the best joke of the meeting award. Isn't that nice? Well, overall, the meeting was really nice, meeting users and developers of Mono was really great. I'm already looking forward another meeting :)<br/> <br/> That's for the two first days of the week. After that, I've been mainly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/281542247/" title="hanging around Novell/Ximian's office">hanging around Novell/Ximian's office</a> , carefully avoiding meetings, and hanging with folks. I walked quite a lot in Boston and Cambridge, and and I loved that. Everything looks so "typical". Basically, a lot of things were just as they were in my imagination. And Boston at this period of the year is really beautiful. My plane takes off tomorrow, and it will be hard to leave such a nice place.<br/> <br/> Well, at least, I'm not alone anymore:<br/> <br/> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/281544205/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Alone with Rupert" height="333" src="http://static.flickr.com/90/281544205_0704a75774.jpg" style="BORDER:2px solid black" width="500"/></a><br/> <br/> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/sets/72157594348740457/" title="Here is my flickr set for the week">Here is my flickr set for the week</a>.<br/> <br/> <br/>
