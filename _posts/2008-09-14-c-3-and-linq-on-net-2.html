My friend <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/">Patrick</a> is <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/09/14/targeting-the-net-runtime-version-2-0-matters.aspx">wondering</a> what's the best way to use the type <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb359438.aspx">System.Collections.Generic.HashSet</a>, in <a href="http://www.ndepend.com">NDepend</a>, that he wants to deploy on computers with only .net 2 installed.

Well it's pretty simple, the best way to get it, is to get it from <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a>. The code is licensed under the MIT/X11 license, allowing multiple usages.

And that's not all. If you're dying to use C#3 or LINQ to objects in your application, but that you want to be able to release on .net 2 only, you can simply compile and ship Mono's implementation of System.Core. Microsoft's C# compiler, csc 3.5, won't have any issue using it, et voil√†, you'll get an application using LINQ or C#3, and deployable on .net 2.

Mono's implementation of System.Core is available in SVN <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs/class/System.Core/">here</a>.
