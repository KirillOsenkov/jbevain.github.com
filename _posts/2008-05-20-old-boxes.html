While <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/May-18-1.html">Miguel</a> was having fun discovering new games, I saved from the dust a few precious boxes.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbevain/2496833474/" title="Relics by Jb Evain, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/2496833474_2294e22c3c.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Relics" style="border: 2px black solid" /></a>

Now that they're safe, I can go back to play Mass Effect.
