<h1>Bio</h1>

<p>Jb is an experienced software engineer with a passion for developer tools who took upon the challenge of creating a developer tools company: <a href="http://syntaxtree.com">SyntaxTree</a>.</p>

<p>He's the author of <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil">Cecil</a>, a open-source .NET binary manipulation library that turned out to be useful to <a href="https://github.com/jbevain/cecil/wiki/Users">many people</a>.

<p>He's been involved in the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a> project (an open-source implementation of the Microsoft .NET framework) for over a decade. In his youth, he has been selected as a student in the very first two editions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code">Google Summer of Code</a> to contribute to Mono where he spent the summers flipping bits instead of burgers.</p>

<p>At SyntaxTree, Jb currently leads the development of <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS</a>, a tool to bridge Microsoft Visual Studio and <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a>, a powerful game creation editor. In just a short few years, UnityVS has growned to be used by thousands, from AAA studios to indies.</p>

<p>Prior to creating SyntaxTree, Jb achieved one of his dream when he joined the Mono team at <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza">Miguel de Icaza</a> where he worked on various parts of the project. He was part of the team of 5 that started the MonoTouch and Mono for Android projects (later becoming the foundations of <a href="http://www.xamarin.com">Xamarin</a>), where he was in charge of the tooling to trim down the size of apps for deployment.</p>

<p>Before Novell, Jb worked at db4objects, a startup creating an open-source object oriented database for Java and .NET. There he worked not only on the database itself, written in Java, but also on the tooling to convert the Java code to .NET, and on .NET specific parts like the LINQ to db4o provider.</p>
