<b>Update</b>: the code has been moved to its own <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/mono.reflection">project page</a>.

Let's consider you're writing a LINQ provider. And that you need to opimize the following LINQ query:

<pre>
from Person p in db where p.Age > 18 select p;
</pre>

Let's add a constraint. The underlying storage engine stores data according to the field name. That would mean that when generating the query for the underlying storage system, you'll have to map <pre>p.Age</pre> into something that the underlying storage system will understand. In that case, a field. And all you have is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.expressions.memberexpression.aspx">MemberExpression</a>, giving you a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.propertyinfo.aspx">PropertyInfo</a>.

The issue here is that you have no way to get the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.fieldinfo.aspx">FieldInfo</a> backing the property. If you think about it, it's normal. The setter and the getter of a property being traditional methods, they can contain any kind of code. Meaning that you can't always find a field backing the property.

But in that case, it's ok, we're only interested in those forms of properties:

<pre>
public int Age { get; set; }

private string name;

public string Name {
    get { return name; }
    set { name = value; }
}
</pre>

Of course here what's interesting is how to actually get the field. I've used the <a href="http://evain.net/blog/articles/2009/04/30/reflection-based-cil-reader">Reflection based CIL reader</a> I wrote about yesterday. I disassemble the body of either a getter or a setter of the property, and if it matches a simple IL pattern, that is, if it looks to be a property backed by a field, I simply return the field.

To do the actual IL matching, I re-implemented something <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bamboo/">Rodrigo</a> and I wrote when we were working on instrumenting assemblies at <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/">db4o</a>. The code itself is pretty neat.

Anyway, that's another opportunity to write a simple extension method:

<pre>
public static FieldInfo GetBackingField (this PropertyInfo self)
</pre>

Again, you're more than welcome to have a look at <a href="http://gist.github.com/104006">the implementation</a>. Don't forget that it depends on the <a href="http://gist.github.com/104001">Reflection based CIL reader</a>.
