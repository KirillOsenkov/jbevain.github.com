      Not only <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> have a very cool name that a lot of people fail to pronounce correctly, but it is also a very cool tool, very programmer friendly.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">SÃ©bastien</a> did a great job setting up this project. A few days ago, I was cleaning some code helped by <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>, and noticed a few times that it suggested that "This method can be made static". It's a little optimization that says that if a method doesn't use the this reference within its body, it can then be static. I guess that the native code the JIT will have to generate is then simpler.<br />
<br />
How to get such warnings while working on Mono? Here comes Gendarme! It was so easy to write this simple rule that I encourage anyone to give it a try, and to try to write some more funky rules. Let's go back to my example, here is the code that tells if a method can be made static or not:
<pre>
using Mono.Cecil;
using Mono.Cecil.Cil;

using Gendarme.Framework;

namespace Gendarme.Rules.Correctness {

	public class MethodCanBeMadeStaticRule : IMethodRule {

		public MessageCollection CheckMethod (MethodDefinition method, Runner runner)
		{
			// we only check non static and non virtual methods
			if (method.IsStatic || method.IsVirtual)
				return runner.RuleSuccess;

			// we only check methods with a body
			if (!method.HasBody)
				return runner.RuleSuccess;

			// if we find a use of the "this" reference, it's ok
			foreach (Instruction instr in method.Body.Instructions)
				if (instr.OpCode == OpCodes.Ldarg_0 ||
					(instr.OpCode == OpCodes.Ldarg && (int) instr.Operand == 0))
					return runner.RuleSuccess;

			return runner.RuleFailure;
		}
	}
}
</pre>

Yeah, simple as that! Isn't that exciting?<br />
<br />
Next step, I've now decided to add to my TODO list to integrate Gendarme to MonoDevelop. What could be nicer?
