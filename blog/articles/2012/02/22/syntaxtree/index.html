      <i>Or “What I have been up to since last September”.</i>

It is no secret that the middle of 2011 was a bumpy time for the Mono team. But let's not babble about something that happened months ago. Suffices to say that September the 15th was my last day at Novell.

I started contributing to Mono in 2005. In 2007, at 24, after being part of the two very first editions of the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>, I was hired full-time. I had an amazing time working this long on a project I deeply care about.

I'm proud of what we've accomplished during this time. And I'm super happy to see how great my friends at <a href="http://www.xamarin.com">Xamarin</a> are doing. Yesterday I was stuck on a plane for quite a long time, and a guy in front of me tinkered for an entire hour in <a href="http://icircuitapp.com/">iCircuit</a>, an amazing application based on <a href="http://ios.xamarin.com/">MonoTouch</a>. As a member of the original MonoTouch team, it felt awesome!

Yet, after the dust settled, I felt like it was time to try something new. Something I've been thinking about for quite a while now. Even though I've been doing a lot of thinking and planning, it took quite a leap of faith, and quite a bit of work.

<h3>Introducing SyntaxTree</h3>

<a href="http://syntaxtree.com">SyntaxTree</a> is a company whose mission is twofold: write great developer tools and help other companies doing so. We obviously have a very strong background on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .NET</a> and Mono platforms, but we've already been helping clients target some very different platforms. You're more than welcome to check <a href="http://syntaxtree.com/services/">SyntaxTree's services page</a> out to have a look at the kind of work we've been doing.

And today <a href="http://syntaxtree.com/blog/2012/02/22/announcing-unityvs/">we announce our first product</a>, <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS</a>, bridging two amazing tools, <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/">Visual Studio</a>.

If you don't already know about it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Wikipedia defines Unity</a> as “an integrated authoring tool for creating 3D video games or other interactive content such as architectural visualizations or real-time 3D animations”. It uses <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a> as a scripting engine and Unity has been part of the Mono community for a long while now.

Our product, <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS</a> adds support in Visual Studio for the languages that programmers can use in Unity to write scripts for their game: <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/index.html">UnityScript</a> and <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>. <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS</a> also adds support for debugging your scripts inside Visual Studio, even when running inside Unity's editor.

I can not stress enough how big of a <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> fan I am. I think that what those guys are achieving, especially towards beginners, is nothing short of amazing. Would Unity have been around when I was 15, instead of writing PHP and JavaScript code, I'm pretty sure I would have spent nights tinkering in Unity, and my career would have ended up to be quite different.

And they happen to have a fantastic taste when it comes to third party code. Using Mono as a scripting engine? Awesome. Using a JavaScript like language based on the Boo compiler infrastructure? Still awesome. Using <a href="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil">Mono.Cecil</a> to the point that they use the word “to cecil [in|out]” as a verb internally? Even more awesome. Using <a href="http://ilspy.net">ILSpy's engine</a> to retarget .net code to ActionScript for their Flash port? Mind blowing.

I'm very excited to work on a product which complements the Unity ecosystem, I hope you'll like it.
