      <br />This morning Hans Cratz announced in the Mono Devel List the preview release of the new x-develop IDE.<br />
I'm currently trying it, and you know what ? I'm happy. I'm switching my current development to it, just to see. At least it seems to be very promising. I have to admit I'm a bit jealous, it seems that I'm not the only one to want an Eclipse#. Yes, it is cross platform, and if I've not tried it under my Linux box, be sure I will.<br />
<br />
Here is a quote from the mail :<br />
<blockquote>
Feature showcase:<br />
<br />
* Instant detection of errors throughout all files<br />
<br />
No need to compile in order to find out if there are errors. X-develop checks all files in the solution on-the-fly in the background and displays errors in an instant.<br />
<br />
* Refactoring<br />
<br />
X-develop includes refactorings for renaming variables, methods, classes, changing method signature, extracting methods and more.<br />
<br />
* Productivity features<br />
<br />
X-develop boosts productivity with coding tools such as Organize imports, Usage search, Code formatting, Smart templates, Go to class, Go to symbol and more.<br />
<br />
* VS.net 2005 compatibility<br />
<br />
X-develop uses the solutio/project concept from VS.net 2005. Solutions/projects created for Windows can be loaded and modified with X-develop on Linux.

It rocks. I'm now playing with code templates, code metrics. There is a lot of good stuff in this. I've not enough time to write a complete review of it, but it's an interesting article idea for DNG.<br />
<br />
Go, try it, and make your own idea. My question now is will it be free ?<br />

<b>Edit</b><br />
I was so excited that I did not even notice that it is written in Java, but does it cares ? A little, I think an Eclipse# written in .net should be a very exciting thing.
