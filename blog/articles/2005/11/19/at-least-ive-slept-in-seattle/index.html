Previously, in Jb in a nutshell: <a href="http://evain.net/blog/index.php/2005/10/22/257-aop-goes-net-workshop">AOP Goes .NET Workshop</a>
</p>
<p>
It was my first trip to US, and I liked it.<br />
It was the first time I had to spend almost 24 hours in planes/airport (just for the trip back), and I hated it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the workshop was interesting. It's clear that Microsoft don't know how to handle the AOP thing, but at least, it helped a bit. It was very interesting to meet people so motivated by working on AOP on .net. And now, they all know that they can use Cecil as a base assembly to write AOP tool!
I will write more on it later on.<br />
<br />
To make you wait, a little game, play to: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/workshops/aop/AOPattendees.jpg">where is Jb</a> ?
