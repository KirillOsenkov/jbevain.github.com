<p>
Two days ago, it was the Saint Jean-Baptiste day. As Jb stands for Jean-Baptiste, this sounds good. Now, the summer can begin.
</p> 
<h3>On Google things</h3>
<p>
My proposal has been accepted! I'm late (i've some reasons), but now, this is sure, i have to, finish Cecil by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Google haved here a really nice idea, some Open Source projects will shine more at the end of the summer.
</p>
<h3>On trips</h3>

<p>
GNOME Games and ipods in trains are damn useful! Just make sure girls won't play with them for the whole trip...
Happily, all of the batteries were low.
</p>
<p>
This morning, I was in the 'Lyon Part Dieu' train station, and i had the good surprise to find here a friend from high school i haven't seen for at least two years. I've waited for his train with him. Enjoy journeying!
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, i'll wake up at 4.am, objective: lunch in Mulhouse, and sleep in Paris. At least ten hours of car.
